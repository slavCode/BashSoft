# BashSoft
A general assignment in the SoftUni's C# Advanced, C# OOP Basics and Advanced courses, which contains all fundamental and advanced C# skills and programming techniques. I will be developing it as I progress throughout the courses. Read the resources for the specified course for more info.

The project resembles a small bash-like terminal program, which has the following functions:

mkdir - Creats new folder
ls - Traverse directory
cmp - Compares two files
cdRel - Changes the relative path
cdAbs - Changes the absolute path
readDb - Reads database
dropDb - Drop database
open - Opens file
show - entries
filter - Filters students by courses
order - Orders students in courses
help - Shows help menu
show - Shows all students in course
quit - Closes the program

Project tasks for each course:
C# Advanced
 Creating the Basic Functionality
 Creating the Data Structure
 Exception Handling
 Implementing the command interpreter
 Regular Expressions
 Functional Programming
 LINQ
C# OOP Basics
 Defining Classes and Methods
 Encapsulation
 Inheritance
 Polymorphism
